                <h3>Backflip</h3>
                <p>A Back Flip is a movement used in Freerunning and tricking. The term "Backflip" can actually refer to several different types of flip, but always refers to a flip that rotates backwards. Back flips have very little practical use in Parkour, but are commonly used by Freerunners and Trickers.</p>

                <h3>Frontflip</h3>
                <p>A Front Flip is a movement used in Freerunning and tricking. The term "Frontflip" can actually refer to several different types of flip, but always refers to a flip rotates forwards (not necessarily moving forwards; gainers are not considered frontflips whereas losers are). Front Flips have very little practical use in Parkour, but are commonly used Freerunners and Trickers.</p>

                <h3>Barani</h3>
                <p>In tricking, this maneuver is occasionally used for ending a tricking line cleanly. The 180 degree turn is carried out usually halfway through the frontflip, though earlier attempts are possible but more dangerous and are unrecommended.</p>
