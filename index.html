                <p>A Front Flip is a movement used in Freerunning and tricking.

                <p>In tricking, this maneuver is occasionally used for ending a tricking line cleanly. The 180 degree turn is carried out usually halfway through the frontflip, though earlier attempts are possible but more dangerous and are unrecommended.</p>

                <h3>cartwheel</h3>
                <p>A Cartwheel is a movement used in tricking. It is performed by rotating the body sideways, placing the hands on the ground, letting the legs move over the head and placing them on the ground again. It is a simple movement, and one of the easiest in tricking. It is an important progression to many other moves such as the roundoff and aerial.</p>
